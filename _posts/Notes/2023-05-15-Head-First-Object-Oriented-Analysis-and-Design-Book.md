# Chapter 1: Great Software Begins Here

this chapter starts with *what is the great software?* question and going to discuss it with a deferent point of views. For example 
- The *customer friend* sees that the great software does what the customer wants it to do and doesn't give un expected result when we use it in a new way.
- The *Object-Oriented Programming* guy sees that the great software has no code duplication, each object controls its own behavior, and finally easy to be extended.
- The *Design Pattern* guy sees that the great software is what used a tried-and-true design patterns and principles. Objects are loosely coupled, Open for extension but closed for modifications. finally the code in the software must be reusable.
- A *Computer science* student in BFCAI that called Hossam Hamdy sees that the great software is the one which following the best design practices and design patterns to not re invent the wheel again, that software that respect customer requirements but in the same time we don't ignore the engineering side.

The Authors provide an approach for writing a great software with a simple steps:
**1. Make sure your software does what customer wants it to do.**
**2. Apply basic OO principles to add flexibilities.**
**3. Strive for a maintainable reusable design.**

In this chapter the authors learn me a new thing about *Encapsulation*, we can use it not only for information hiding, but also we can use it to remove duplicated codes. in the following code snippet we have the Guitar class that used in a *ArrayList <Guitar> search(Guitar guitar)* that implemented to take each class data member and compare with the client needs. 

```java
public class Guitar { Â 
Â  Â  private String serialNumber;
Â  Â  private double price;
Â  Â  private Builder builder;
Â  Â  private String model;
Â  Â  private Type type;
Â  Â  private Wood backWood;
Â  Â  private Wood topWood;
Â  Â  public String getSerialNumber() {return serialNumber;}
Â  Â  public void setSerialNumber(String serialNumber) {this.serialNumber = serialNumber;}
Â  Â  public double getPrice() {return price;}
Â  Â  public void setPrice(double price) {this.price = price;}
Â  Â  public Builder getBuilder() {return builder;}
Â  Â  public void setBuilder(Builder builder) {this.builder = builder;}
Â  Â  public String getModel() {return model;}
Â  Â  public void setModel(String model) {this.model = model;}
Â  Â  public Type getType() {return type;}
Â  Â  public void setType(Type type) {this.type = type;}
Â  Â  public Wood getBackWood() {return backWood;}
Â  Â  public void setBackWood(Wood backWood) {this.backWood = backWood;}
Â  Â  public Wood getTopWood() {return topWood;}
Â  Â  public void setTopWood(Wood topWood) {this.topWood = topWood;}
Â }
Â ```

The problem is that the client doesn't really care about guitar serial number or price so that he doesn't provide the search method with this information which make the search method doesn't do its job properly because some data members are Null.
so that we can use the Encapsulation to separate the not necessary data from the Guitar object to a new object used for searching such as *GuitarSpec* that hold all necessary information about the target guitar.

The new Guitar Class code: 

```java
public class Guitar {
Â  Â  private String serialNumber;
Â  Â  private double price;
Â  Â  // each guitar object must have a GuitarSpec object to descripe it.
Â  Â  private GuitarSpec guitarSpec;
Â  Â  public String getSerialNumber(){
	Â  Â  return serialNumber;
	} Â 
Â  Â  public void setSerialNumber(String serialNumber) {
	Â  Â  this.serialNumber = serialNumber;
	} 
Â  Â  public GuitarSpec getGuitarSpec() {
	Â  Â  return serialNumber;
	} Â 
Â  Â  public void setGuitarSpec(GuitarSpec guitarSpec) {
	Â  Â  this.guitarSpec = guitarSpec;
	}
Â }
```

The GuitarSpec Class code: 

```java
public class GuitarSpec { Â 
Â  Â  private Builder builder; Â 
Â  Â  private String model; Â 
Â  Â  private Type type; Â 
Â  Â  private Wood backWood; Â 
Â  Â  private Wood topWood; Â 
Â  Â  public Builder getBuilder() {return builder;} Â 
Â  Â  public void setBuilder(Builder builder) {this.builder = builder;} Â 
Â  Â  public String getModel() {return model;} Â 
Â  Â  public void setModel(String model) {this.model = model;} Â 
Â  Â  public Type getType() {return type;} Â 
Â  Â  public void setType(Type type) {this.type = type;} Â 
Â  Â  public Wood getBackWood() {return backWood;} Â 
Â  Â  public void setBackWood(Wood backWood) {this.backWood = backWood;} Â 
Â  Â  public Wood getTopWood() {return topWood;} Â 
Â  Â  public void setTopWood(Wood topWood) {this.topWood = topWood;} Â 
Â }
```

With this approach we have a good design because in the future if we wanna add a new prosperity to the Guitar we don't need to change the guitar class each time we have a new changes, we just need to add it into the GuitarSpec and the *search()* method will do it's job. we separate application's parts and encapsulate the part tat might vary/change away from the parts that will stay the same.
**`Anytime you see duplicate code, look for a place to encapsulate`**.

**Delegation** The act of one object forwarding an operation to another object, to be performed on behalf of the first object. such as *.equals()* method in java. delegation enables the code reusability, and make it **loosely coupled** (the object have a specific job to do and they do only that job).

| Idiom | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| Functionality | Without me, youâ€™ll never actually make the customer happy. No matter how well-designed your application is, Iâ€™m the thing that puts a smile on the customerâ€™s face |
| Flexibility | Use me so that your software can change and grow without constant rework. I keep your application from being fragile |
| Encapsulation | You use me to keep the parts of your code that stay the same separate from the parts that change; then itâ€™s really easy to make changes to your code without breaking everything |
| Design Pattern | Iâ€™m all about reuse and making sure youâ€™re not trying to solve a problem that someone else has already figured out. |

# Chapter 02: Gathering Requirements

In this chapter the authors will introduce a simple approach to help you to gather customer requirements with detailed use cases.
Letâ€™s answer the questions of What is the requirement?
*Requirement* is a specific thing your system has to do to work correctly. It's about what a particular service should do.


### Listen to the customer
To gather requirements, we need to listen to the customer carefully and pay attention to everything he says about the system wanna have/ or feature wanna add. In listening phase, we care about **what system has to do? ** not **How we'll implement this? **

Focusing on implementation details in this phase is a big mistake that i unfortunately do in meetings. This makes me drop some necessary details in requirements and start thinking about the limitations of used technologies or on the other side start saying "yes it's easy we can implement and deliver this method/feature in 3 hours" but it's not true at all ðŸ˜©.


### Create Requirements List

After we listen to the customer requirements, we need to create a list of them as the image below.

After creating the list, we validate requirements with the customer to make sure that we are all on the same level of understanding of what the system has to do. We can get approval in the best case, and also, we get some comments on the requirements list as a change needed.

Be aware that the happy case doesn't always happen in our real world, so our requirements might have an *alternative paths* that handle the situation when things going wrong and unexpected.

the *Use case* idiom describes what your system does to accomplish a particular customer goal. it provides one or more scenarios that convey how the system should interact with the end-user or another system to achieve a goal.


**One great use case is consists of 3 parts:**

| Part | Description |
|:--:|:--:|
| Clear value | The use case must have a clear value to our system, if itâ€™s not then the use case isn't of much use |
| Start and Stop Condition | Each use case mush have a defined starting and ending conditions. when to start and when the process must be ended |
| External Initiator | Each use case is started by external actor outside the system |


The use case must be written in a clear language to be understandable for your customers, managers, and developersâ€™ team. so that the use case doesn't have technical details.

You might think writing use cases is a waste of time and effort, but it's not what you think. Writing use cases helps you to figure out the edge cases and alternative paths that happens when things go wrong. By thinking about coding without take care of well written use cases we just think about happy scenarios only, the use case helps us to be aware of what we might face in the future. Remember that the first step of writing a great software is having satisfied customers.

### Check requirements against use cases
The last step is to check requirements against use cases, this helps us in validate the requirements and have the green light to start coding ðŸ™‚. here we make sure that all gathered requirements are covering all system aspects and functionalities.

# Chapter 03: Requirements Change

In this short chapter, the authors introduce the "**Change**" concept in the OOA&D world as it is the only constant. I agree with that change is the only constraint t in our world today.

well-designed use cases help us to implement our requirements after doing some changes easily and quickly as we don't need to worry about unexpected scenarios. so the authors advise us to use our use cases to find out about things our customers forget to tell us.

The steps of your main path in the use case list must be the steps that will happen **most often** in your project, others will be the alternative path. from the start step to the end, we call this path a **scenario**, Most use cases will have several scenarios but they always have the same user goal.

Any time we do changes to our use cases the requirements change too, so after any change, we need to go back to our requirements and check them again. *Change is constant, and your system should always improve every time you work on it.*

# Chapter 04: Analysis

### Analysis
it is about figuring out potential problems, and then solving problems before you release your application out into the real world. 

Analysis and your use cases let you show customers, managers, and other developers how your system works in a real world context not just in your controlled environment -happy scenario-.

**Delegation** shields your objects from implementation changes to other objects in your software. it protect our code from changes due to changes happening to other objects.

**Textual analysis** is about looking at *`nouns`* in your use case to figure out *`potential classes`*, and *`methods`*.

Maybe You didn't use cases and still create good software, but it's good to use them to satisfy your customers more often. and it's good to make sure your software does what it's supposed to do.

Pay attention to the nouns in your use case, even when they arenâ€™t classes in your system, because textual analysis helps us with what to focus on, not just what classes you need. in some cases you will found nouns in your use case but it's not really needed to be a class in your system. such as in the following example:

![](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/cba12cf2-a91f-4158-a2b8-f12d100be83c)


in this example we didn't need to create a `Dog` class because we don't need to track the dog we just need its bark sound, or it's not making sense to store the dog in the dog door -*at least for me :)*-, and finally the dog is an external factor from our system.

Pay attention to verbs in your use case, it's usually the methods of the class in your system.

### Class diagram

![](https://github.com/0xGhazy/0xGhazy/assets/60070427/a9741a47-72c6-47cb-808b-73763f682457)

The class diagram contains some information about relationships between classes and inner components such as data members and methods.

from the image above we can see that:
- solid lines from one class to another are called "association" it means that one class is associated with another class by reference, extension, inheritance, etc.
- on that solid line we write the name of the attribute where the association takes place.
- the number at the end of the line is the number of attributes, if it's 1 it's called `multiplicity`, otherwise it's called `unlimited` and it's denoted by `*`.

class diagrams aren't everything because it has limited *type* information we don't know the data structure that uses them if we have iterable objects is it List, ArrayList, Vector, or custom objects. Class diagrams also don't tell us about how to code our methods, it's only give us a 10,000-foot view of our system as what authors mention on page 187.

at the end of this chapter remember that **rewriting code takes a lot more time than rewriting a use case or redrawing a class diagram**
