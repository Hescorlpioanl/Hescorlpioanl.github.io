Hi, I'm Hossam Hamdy, and it's my first time writing this kind of post. I was inspired to write this type by a publication by engineer [Medhat Dawoud](https://twitter.com/med7atdawoud) on his blog, [link](https://www.medhat.dev/blog/actually-it -was-a-great-year-2020-recap/). I found this type of post very inspiring for me, as it can motivate other to write, as happened to me. Or it will be a documentation of the moments and situations that I experienced during my experiences, to benefit from the lessons, remember what I learned, and follow my personal and technical development.

## Writing technical posts

I have been writing several posts on my blog, starting with the Graduation Project Diary series and notes posts on technical books I have read. And some general publications explaining projects I worked on or design patterns I made.

I am very happy to have written these posts, and most of them are a summary of the book Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. I see that my style and the quality of the posts have improved compared to before. I hope you get better in the coming months and years.

## Reading technical books

I have read technical books this year, and it is clear that I have not read any non-technical books compared to previous years. I will pay attention to that matter during the coming period.

## I gave my speech on stage

I went up on stage and gave my speech at a celebration in front of teachers, parents, and high school students to tell the story of my experience in high school, the problems I faced, and how I overcame them. I was honored by my teacher, `Ibrahim Al-Shaer` whom I was a student in 2019. The years passed quickly, faster than I thought.

## Finish the graduation project

We put a lot of effort into our graduation project, yet there was a delay in its completion due to the delay in the deep learning model, which is the backbone of the project and its connection with the backend. The project also contained many errors, whether in the design of the backend or the deep learning model. My friend [Ahmed Al-Shaarawy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marconoyet/) and I worked three continuous nights on the project with the intention of finishing it on time, and we finished it one day before the discussion time üòÉ. A difficult period, but moments of hard work and lots of laughter.

I wish the rest of the team had been with us, but we finished faster and had some fun time together. I would like to thank them all, appreciate and respect their efforts, and wish them success in their professional and social lives.

## Graduated from BFCAI

I discussed my graduation project on `21-Jun-2023`. Our discussion was nice, although it did not last 15 minutes, and we all received an A+ rating. Although I am happy to finish the project, there are many mixed feelings. I am happy that all these difficult times of study and psychological pressure are over, and I am happy with all the fun times I had with friends and I am happy that I got to know many friends during this period.

And I'm sad because some friends I'll never get to see. I wish I could tell them now that I love them and that I will never forget them. My communication with them may be little or no for some reasons, but I still remember them and their love is in my heart as it is, no matter how many days pass, I will always be there. I wish them good luck and success in what comes next ‚ù§

## Got engaged to the most girl I have ever loved

On `15-Aug-2023` I proposed to the girl I have loved since the first year of university, since my eyes saw her for the first time in Section 8. She is what I was always looking for. I love her very much and she is the girl I have loved the most ‚ù§

## Attending Zoholics 2023 in Cairo

I attended the Zoho conference in Egypt, which was my first time attending, and there I met many old friends, business owners, and some speakers in the field of digital transformation.

It was a great experience to get the latest updates in Zoho apps, and at the event, I met a lot of Zoho developers with different levels of experience. This allows me to see where I stand and where I stand with this technology.

## Update my GitHub Profile

I've updated my GitHub profile to add the books I'm currently reading, projects I'm working on, as well as my skills and social media profiles. Which was greatly admired by my friends, which made me very happy because of their admiration and encouragement to write their own profiles.

## I've left Flow Tech House 

On `26-Nov-2023`, I left [Flow Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7134533025891037184/) after 13 months of work during my studies and after graduation. During this period I learned a lot of things about Zoho. This period also affected my personality on many levels. Likewise, even if not all times were good, no one learns for free. I hope for payment and success in what comes next.
